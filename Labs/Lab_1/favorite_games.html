            it never gets old. Despite everything that's been added over the years, the basic formula of it hasn't changed all that much, and I think that's part of its charm. It can be a simple survival game, it 
            can be one of the most complex engineering games if that's your cup of tea, or it can be a sandbox for creatives to flourish. And that's not to mention its thriving modding community that adds even more 
            variety in the various versions that exist.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); padding: 10px;">Omori is definitely one of the more unique RPGs I've played ever. I was initially drawn to it by its sketch art style, creator's collaboration with a V-Tuber group I'm a fan of, 
          and through a close friend's recommendation. What I got when I played was, yes, great visuals, but also a deep, emotional story that kept me invested throughout my journey, a fantastic soundtrack that I still listen 
          to occassionally outside of the game, and a combat system that utilzies a unique mechanic in the form of emotions that I've seen few, if any, other games use in the way Omori does.

      <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); padding: 10px;">The internet has sung its praise for this game enough, especially with the way its sequel maintained a cult-like following up until its release last year.
            Can't really blame them either, as the original is a fantastic Metroidvania, probably the best I've played to-date. Its setting really sets the tone of desolateness and mystery as you maneuver through Hallownest; its soundtrack supporting that tone while journeying,
            but drastically ramping up in intensity when boss fights occur. Customization with charms allow for lots of different playstyles, which I'm fond of.
